# rando

Simple app for making collections of stuff and easily rolling a die to pick one at random. You could have, for example, a list of restaraunts, and just tap the associated dice icon to pick one at random.

## TODO

1) Need to rename from `com.example.rando` to `org.zakariya.rando`
2) Need to move up one level from `Rando/rando` to `Rando`
