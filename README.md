# rando

Simple app for making collections of stuff and easily rolling a die to pick one at random. You could have, for example, a list of restaraunts, and just tap the associated dice icon to pick one at random.

## TODO

1) ~~Need to rename from `com.example.rando` to `org.zakariya.rando`~~
2) ~~[Refactor state flow](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)~~
3) Refactor/cleanup UI
