# rando

Simple app for making collections of stuff and easily rolling a die to pick one at random. You could have, for example, a list of restaraunts, and just tap the associated dice icon to pick one at random.

## TODO

1) ~Need to rename from `com.example.rando` to `org.zakariya.rando`~
2) [Refactor state flow](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)
3) Refactor/cleanup UI
    - [use a grid for main list](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/lists/grid-lists)
    - [Draggable Scrollable Sheet](https://medium.com/flutter-community/useful-flutter-widget-draggablescrollablesheet-know-it-all-e5cc6c48528e)
